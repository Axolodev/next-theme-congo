Mermaid diagrams are supported in Congo using the `mermaid` shortcode. Simply wrap the diagram markup within the shortcode. Congo automatically themes Mermaid diagrams to match the configured `colorScheme` parameter.

Refer to the [mermaid shortcode](ref "docs/shortcodes#mermaid" >}}) docs for more details.

The examples below are a small selection taken from the [official Mermaid docs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/). You can also [view the page source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpanther/congo/dev/exampleSite/content/samples/diagrams-flowcharts.md) on GitHub to see the markup.
