Congo includes support for Chart.js using the `chart` shortcode. Simply wrap the chart markup within the shortcode. Congo automatically themes charts to match the configured `colorScheme` parameter, however the colours can be customised using normal Chart.js syntax.

Refer to the [chart shortcode](ref "docs/shortcodes#chart" >}}) docs for more details.

The examples below are a small selection taken from the [official Chart.js docs](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples). You can also [view the page source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpanther/congo/dev/exampleSite/content/samples/charts.md) on GitHub to see the markup.
