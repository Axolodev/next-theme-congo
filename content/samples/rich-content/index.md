Hugo ships with several [built-in shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) for rich content, along with a [privacy config](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/) and a set of _simple shortcodes_ that enable static and no-JS versions of various social media embeds.

## YouTube

Below is an example using the built-in `youtube` shortcode.



## Twitter

This example uses the `twitter_simple` shortcode to output a Tweet. It requires two named parameters `user` and `id`.



Alternatively, the `tweet` shortcode can be used to embed a fully marked up Twitter card.

## Gist

The `gist` shortcode can be used to embed a GitHub Gist. It requires two unnamed parameters: the username and ID of the Gist.



## Vimeo

The `vimeo_simple` shortcode will embed a Vimeo video.
